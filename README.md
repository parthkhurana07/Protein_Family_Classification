# Protein Classification Project

This repository contains code for a protein classification project. The project aims to classify proteins into different categories based on various features. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of two CSV files: `pdb_data_no_dups.csv` containing metadata and `pdb_data_seq.csv` containing sequence information of proteins.

## Model Training

Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to classify proteins into different categories. Split the data into training and testing sets, trained the model, and evaluated its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the KNN model. Evaluated the best parameters and score obtained from the grid search.
